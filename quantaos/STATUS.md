# QuantaOS Status

Hobby x86-64 kernel written in Rust. Educational/portfolio project. NOT a production OS.

The `.quanta` file (`lib.quanta`) describes the design in QuantaLang syntax.
The actual implementation lives in `kernel/src/` (Rust, `#![no_std]`).

## Build

- Target: `x86_64-quantaos.json` (custom bare-metal target, `rust-lld` linker)
- Dependencies: `spin 0.9`, `bitflags 2.4`, `static_assertions 1.1`, `libm 0.2`
- Nightly Rust required (`abi_x86_interrupt`, `alloc_error_handler`, `negative_impls`)
- The kernel compiles to `libquantaos_kernel.rlib` (build artifacts exist)
- UEFI bootloader in `bootloader/` (depends on `uefi 0.31`)
- QEMU run script in `scripts/run-qemu.sh`
- **Has it booted on real hardware?** Unknown. QEMU-only as far as artifacts show.

## Syscalls

71 `sys_*` handler functions total.

- **66 implemented** with real logic (file I/O, process ops, memory, time, sockets, IPC, signals, poll/select)
- **5 stubs** that return `-1` with `// TODO: Implement`:
  `sys_ai_query`, `sys_ai_infer`, `sys_ai_tensor_alloc`, `sys_ai_tensor_free`, `sys_ai_tensor_share`
- `sys_ai_priority_boost` delegates to scheduler (implemented)
- `sys_checkpoint`, `sys_restore`, `sys_heal` delegate to healing engine (partially implemented)

## Honest Assessment of Headline Features

**"Self-Healing Engine"** -- The `healing.rs` module has checkpoint/restore data structures,
an anomaly detector with statistical scaffolding (mean/stddev), and recovery event tracking.
It is a real subsystem with real code. It does NOT contain a trained ML model or neural network.
The "anomaly detection using ML" described in comments is aspirational -- it uses basic
statistical thresholds, not machine learning.

**"Neural scheduling"** -- The scheduler has a class called "AI-optimized scheduler for neural
workloads" in `sched/classes.rs`. The comment admits: "Would use neural network to predict."
It does not. This is a priority-boost mechanism, not neural scheduling.

**"AI inference in the kernel"** -- The AI subsystem (`ai.rs`) defines model and tensor
structures. The 5 core AI syscalls are stubs returning -1. No inference engine exists.
The infrastructure (tensor types, model loading API) is designed but not functional.

**Can it boot?** -- Build artifacts exist (`libquantaos_kernel.rlib`). A UEFI bootloader
and QEMU script exist. The boot sequence in `kernel_main` is well-structured. Whether it
successfully boots in QEMU has not been independently verified.

## Relationship to QUANTA-UNIVERSE

This is one module in the larger QUANTA-UNIVERSE ecosystem. The `lib.quanta` file (50K+ tokens)
is the QuantaLang design specification. The `kernel/src/` Rust code is the implementation.
They describe the same system but the `.quanta` file includes aspirational design elements
that are not yet implemented in Rust.
